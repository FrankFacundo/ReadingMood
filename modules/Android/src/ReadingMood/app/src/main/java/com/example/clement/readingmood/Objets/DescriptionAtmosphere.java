        administration.add("The ceiling must be twenty feet high. Designs of fruit and flowers are carved into the moulding and small, fat children with wings look down at us from every angle. Vases of blossoms give off a cloying scent that makes my eyes itch.");
        administration.add("The city loves me in ways no person ever has. It listens to my fierce footsteps, the clicking of my polished heels against it's dirty pavements early on a Monday morning. It sees me smile ear to ear when I see the windows on it's skyscrapers reflect the orange glow of the afternoon sun. It empathises with my frustrated groan long past midnight when I can't flag down a taxi to take me home. It hears my satisfied sigh in winter as the first sip of a morning coffee warms my throat and thaws my freezing hands. It celebrates with me when I'm on top of the world and cries for me when life gets hard. The city sees and hears and feels every moment of every day of my life. The city understands.");
        administration.add("Before the virus the city was always moving; cars, people, busses, trains. All those people making the organic part of the city, the part that determined the character and the structures. Those people dreamed of stadiums and theatres, they built ice-rinks and laid out parks with soccer pitches. They built churches, mosques and temples. There were hospitals, libraries, police stations, courts and jails. They made the roads wide and the tower blocks tall. Sometimes in the dark I can still hear the cars and imagine a street so busy I must weave between the people. Every other other Canadian was carrying a cup, or so it seemed, and the coffee shops sprang up faster than springtime weeds. Back then I wished there weren't so many people, trust me, that's not one you ever want to be granted. The city was always quieter at night though, perhaps that's another reason I prefer the night. But even then there were lights everywhere, from cars, restaurants, apartments and late-night shops.");
        administration.add("This was alway a city of the haves and have-nots. There were those in West-Van with their exotic cars and luxury life style and those on Hastings Street, drug addled and abused. Of course there was a huge middle class that was neither. Working all their waking hours to give their kids ski lessons, music lessons, two sports clubs and foreign vacations. After the virus we were equal for a short time. Equal in our grief, our losses, our mental disarray. There was no shortage of nice homes to move into so long as you removed the dead. No amount of money could save you, you either won the genetic lottery or you didn't.  The city was ghostly for those frozen weeks, no-one moved for fear of contracting the virus. Then hunger took over and the looting began. Cowering behind locked doors saved no-one, eventually it found a way in under the door or down the chimney. Most of the people who fled to the country came back too, no idea how to farm, no tolerance for the back breaking work.");
        administration.add("In the winter I thought that the coldness of this city was seasonal, that with the spring warmth it would transform and I could feel at home. I was mistaken. Even in the summer there is no softening of the chill. Service is without a smile; fast, efficient, mechanical. There is no greenery at all, the planters installed by some optimistic architect remain bare, not even a weed. It is clean and utterly soul-less. There is no music unless it is the tinny prelude to a police announcement, there are no street vendors, there are no street artists or brightly covered store fronts. Everything is monochrome from the stores, to cars to clothing. When I got here I wore a red woollen jacket and orange mitts but apparently you can't get hired looking like that. Now my black heeled shoes strike the grey cement and my black overcoat descends to my knees. My hat is black and as a small act of defiance my scarf is the softest of blues, almost grey.");



        anger.add("For the most part, addictions are to stuff that's bad for you; that's how I was with anger. When things calmed down, when everything was nice, that's when I'd find fault in someone or something. I was the the emotional volcano, convinced it was the fault of others, or circumstance.I never wanted to be that way; it's the trait I most disrespect in others... maybe that explains a lot. Don't they say that most folks are mean not because they struggle to like you, but because they struggle to like themselves? Ted said, \"Respond, don't react, breathe, take yourself out of the situation, be a fly on the wall for a second, let love back in.\" It's not like that was magic. I still blew hot, but it became better over time, less often. I started to see the real things that caused it, not the things I believed I was angry about. It was the petty frustrations of life, the things that flicked my anxiety switches, that or the things that made me sad. I'd felt entitled to better treatment from others, consideration and respect. I still think I'm worthy of those things, but these days I let it go, trust that the right people will come into my world. It took a while, but the addiction is over. Now it's the reverse, and in any anger situation I'm the cool one, the help instead of being part of the problem.");
        anger.add("My anger would come like an impossible build up steam, burning me on the way out, burning the one on the receiving end. I can tell you honestly, every time I ever blew I reckoned the other person deserved it. There was the explosion and then the mental framework afterwards to avoid guilt, avoid owning the shame that was mine. That's how I stayed so foolish for so long, so immature, refusing to learn over and over - sacrificing who I was supposed to be to keep a pristine ego. But that pain, that realisation, when I let it in, was more school than any classroom ever was. If I kept on being angry, how could I love anyone right? How could I begin to love myself?");
        anger.add("Winston rested his head in his hands. What a night. Either someone screaming or car horns honking. He just needed an unbroken night and he'd be a new boy. The teacher was droning on about atoms, nucleus this, electron that, then a question directed right at him. He raised his red laced eyeballs from the graffiti on the desk to look at the bespectacled man in the tweedy suit. Tut tut, no studying, Winston; Study? Where? In their family's single motel room there was no place quiet and he wasn't allowed out after dark anyway. His brothers and sisters screamed, threw tantrums and the television droned on, looney tunes mostly. His fingers curled tightly around his pencil, he could to see the man's neck snapping in his mind and it felt good. He could feel his fist smashing into his nose, splattering red blood on the dirty walls. What an improvement that would be. But instead he just replied as if his jaw were wired shut. No, sir.");
        anger.add("I held it back as long as I could, then I let go.  They encircled me, each of the five taller than me.  At first, they just called me names, but then they pushed \"the button.\"  The leader poked me in the chest.  I grabbed that hand and bent it back to his chin, while punching him in the stomach at the same time.  One grabbed my left arm and I whirled to land one solidly on his jaw, right below his eye. He went down.  Two of the other three held my arms while another punk hit me in the stomach twice. I kicked him solidly in the midsection, which knocked the breathe out of him.  He bent over but didn't fall. When I kicked the guy in the gut, I pushed the others back and and we all went down. I hit the pavement getting up.  One was on all fours, and I kicked at his chin and landed a hard one on his head.  The other was up and ran at me to tackle me. I stiff-armed him and pushed him to the ground.  While they were regaining their balances, I slipped away. I dreaded seeing them tomorrow.");
        anger.add("Lara didn't even know she was angry until Tom did it again. The used tissue arced from his hand as if in slow motion, coming to rest on her new cream couch. The bark of her voice even surprised her. Get your filthy snot rags of the couch;  He looked at her through wide red-rimmed eyes, his mouth slightly open and a glisten of snot above his cracked lips. She knew she should reign it in, apologize before she made it worse, but she just didn't have it in her to stop. Her words crashed out unchecked, unaltered. It's just lazy, OK? Lazy, disgusting and vile. Get your damn bogey rags off my couch;  Her second voice was urging her to stop, but this was an explosion in progress, no reverse gear, no dampeners. Lara's every word was clipped, punching into the air. She jabbed the air with a pointed finger at each utterance, her eyes narrowed and set hard...Tom, you are a mess. What the hell are you doing here? Wrecking my place? Giving me your germs? Out! Go home! Tom stood, swaying ...");

        attic.add("The attic with its low beams was made all the smaller by the heaps of dusty \"gems.\" Every one of them had been stored in battered boxes and garbage sacks for later use or enjoyment. In truth it was a graveyard for these treasures, a place for them to quietly die amongst the cobwebs until their sentimental value had waned. Out of sight was out of mind and the pain of parting with the item postponed. Were they ever to be retrieved the mildew and the dankness would have ruined cloth and electronics alike. Nancy was aware of all of this, yet she still pulled on the rope to call the ladder down and scaled it with her son's kindergarten books in another black sac. At the top she placed it on the last patch of bare floor and retreated to the warmth of the house.");
        attic.add("The attic was like those in many dwellings in the neighbourhood in that it was tall and fully boarded. Sure it was difficult to stand right at the edges where the roof sloped down, but there was plenty of room even for the tallest of adults. But unlike the others rather than being full of junk it had been slept in every night for the winter months. The reverend had started with just one homeless parishioner, but word of shelter and a warm bed had spread and now they filtered in at dinner time and left after breakfast. His neighbours had taken it in good humour at first, but now that talk was of down-and-outs mingling with the children and drug-abusers wandering the street from breakfast until dinner. It wasn't long before a delegation arrived at this door demanding a \"stop to all this nonsense.\"");
        attic.add("Sitting among the bare beams with his Tolkien book balanced on his drawn up knees, Ravi thought about whether it was right or wrong to play hooky in the attic. He knew Mom would want him in class, but the thought of the other kids eating lunch in front of him when there was no food for him to take was just overwhelming. Here at least he could be hungry in peace. He stood up and wiped the grime from the small circular window and then repositioned himself where the light streamed in. It smelt of staleness and dust but that window was fixed, no chance of freshening things up. Sometimes he thought her heard a rat scuttle or a bird on the roof, but then he reabsorbed himself in Frodo's adventure and everything else melted away.");
        attic.add("I walked into my closet to get my clothes. I looked up at the attic hatch -I loved to dream of what was inside. There could be gold, diamonds, futuristic technology and more. But my mum wouldn't let me go up. I thought for a second \"Would my mum notice if I just took a small peek?\" So I pulled it down and climbed up the ladder. It was dusty and boring. I walked over to a cardboard box and looked inside. There were pictures of strangers who I suppose forgot about them when they moved out. They were black and white, but browned with age. The people in them were as old as most grandparents. Then I moved to the next boxes finding a few old coins in a small purse from the nineteen thirties. Then I heard my mum saying \"Honey, where are you?\"");
        attic.add("The old painting leans against the wall, dusty and unloved. Petra runs a finger along the gold framing, her pink nail polish almost purple in the half-light, and it comes away dirty. In the grime that must have taken years to form there is now a streak of gold. She holds it up. With the light that struggles to make it through the grime on the window the colours are subdued, but she can already tell it's a country scene. The hills roll green, interwoven with the golds of autumn. How it could have lain here in the dark for so long without her knowing? She moves slowly down the attic stairs, one hand on the rungs, one on the painting. It's time for it to have pride of place...");


        bathroom.add("The bathroom could be described as somewhat dilapidated. The formica peeled from the vanities and the enamel was chipped in the sink. Water leaked from the base of the faucet when it was in use. But it was scrupulously clean, the old tarnished mirror sparkled in the morning light and the bath, though also chipped, was as brilliant white as any in a showroom. The towels were fragrant, fluffy and carefully folded on a thrift-store chair in the corner.");
        bathroom.add("One golden faucet in the king's bathroom could have paid for the surgery that could have saved his sister's life, or paid for water sanitization for the whole village. He didn't think of himself as a particularly blood thirsty rebel, but as his eyes fell from one solid gold fixture to the next, his attitude solidified. He would be the executioner himself if he could.");
        bathroom.add("Toothpaste splattered mirror, toothpaste congealed on the counters and sinks, mildew growing around grotty faucets, peeling vinyl flooring trapping blackened dirt and grime, overflowing laundry basket, dirty clothes on the floor, dust and hair around the bath-tub, thick line of grime making a high tide mark around the tub, assortment of shampoo bottles, some empty, slimy bar or soap welded to the edge of the bath, pink scum growing around toilet bowl, hair in the shower drain, pile of old razors, towel rack half hanging on the wall, used damp towel cast onto the floor in a crumpled heap, tiles falling off wall in shower.");
        bathroom.add("In late summer the Earth is ready for the rains, for sweet drops to quench the soils. It is then that the pitter patter returns to the woodlands, simple water to bring nature's magic. The pathways strengthen from a dusty brown to deep mahogany, reviving a healthy glow I've longed to see return. Summer foliage has it's time, the green canopy to give shelter when it's needed, yet this is beauty also, the heaven-given promise seasonal changes fulfilled.");
        bathroom.add("The rain brings a richness to each hue, the browns deepen in a way that soothes my heart, brings a steadiness to my soul. The grass becomes glossy, reflecting the light, a new bright shine to their wands, softly waving in the breeze. This rain brings a freshness, each drop a heaven-given gift for each part of creation. I raise up my hand, tilt my face toward the sky, feeling water and sunshine together. As I do, a song stirs within, one that feels as if it means \"thank you\" and \"love\" all at once. Perhaps this is joy, a happiness that feels pure.");


        bedroom.add("The room contained a small bed, neatly made, two straight-backed chairs,<br>a washstand, a bureau--without any mirror--and a small table. There were<br>no drapery curtains at the dormer windows, no pictures on the wall. All<br>day the sun had been pouring down upon the roof, and the little room<br>was like an oven for heat. As there were no screens, the windows had not<br>been raised. A big fly was buzzing angrily at one of them now, up and<br>down, up and down, trying to get out.");
        bedroom.add("The buyers paused to look in what they thought must be a cupboard, but instead on the other side was a bedroom. It had clearly belonged to a child, and a loved one at that. There were so many posters of Liverpool Football Club on the walls that they really weren't to sure of the paint colour behind them. The bed was not pushed up against a wall but more central with an elaborate mahogany headboard. On the night stand was The Prisoner of Azkaban, and on newspaper was a pair of cleated boots still with residues of mud on the sides. Yet the bed itself had no covers and over it all lay a thick layer of pristine dust. Not a footfall had disturbed this room in some time. They looked to one another, their previously cheerful faces wiped of all emotion and without a word closed the door.");
        bedroom.add("The bedroom was furnished on a meagre budget but if was full of more warmth than Clara had seen in many years. On the back wall was a mural, a tree with every colour of fall leaf imaginable and a few more besides. On the crude pine bed was a hand embroidered orange cover. From every wall smiled black and white photographs of herself as a child with her mother, her father and her sister, Eliza. She had spent so much time living away, in barracks, in field tents, on foreign bases, that she had become unaccustomed to these little touches. Then Eliza bustled in with a tray of sandwiches and cake, her face so tired but wearing the same smile she always reserved for her twin. It was going to be strange to be here again, but wonderful. A place to recover, to find her feet again and this was just the bedroom for it.");
        bedroom.add("Hazel looked about her in amazement.  This was her little room!  A small single bed, looking like a snow drift, so white and feathery and high was it; one window curtained with a square of starched white cotton cloth that drew over the panes by means of a white cord on which it was run at the top; a tiny wash-stand with an old-fashioned bowl and pitcher of green and white stone-ware, and over it an old-fashioned gilt mirror; a small splint-bottomed chair and large braided rug of red woollen rags. That was all, except in one corner, where some cleats had been nailed to the ceiling and a clothes-press made by hanging from them full curtains of white cloth.");
        bedroom.add("The room is blue with beautiful murals on the wall, hand painted by someone who knew what they were doing. The scene is of the stilt walkers that cruise down the Vancouver streets in the winter festival. The colours are like nothing else, vibrant, strong. No washed out blues and insipid baby colours for this poor kid, whoever he was. And it was a he, all the clothing is for a boy Darwin's age. All new looking and expensive. Beautiful cords and close-knit sweaters. I'll take anything that isn't red. A quick look in the closet gets me a rucksack, no good for anything but emergencies; it's every bit as bright as everything else in here.");

        calm.add("This path of life is challenge enough, without making mountains out of molehills, and yeah, we all see the craggy mountain of ice when we are afraid, triggered, maxed out emotionally... So instead of that high drama, breathe... let your energy come down to something softer... then breathe a few more times and watch that big 'ol scarface hill become something more friendly. Perception is everything. The only thing you can ever truly control is yourself, and that's something you can learn. So love everyone, including yourself... lay yourself down through the panic if you must, imagine you have no hands if it helps, or that you're meditating on the moon... whatever works... but when adults keep their panic and fear to themselves, they protect others. Calm returns. Self respect grows. Self control emerges. You gain liberty and maturity with empathy and greater self-reflection. We must be the calm mentors our children look toward for guidance, the keepers of deep wisdom and infinite love... that's what we should develop into... the kind of person every kid is blessed to be loved by.");
        calm.add("Darcey lay on the couch, feet twitching to music only she could hear, face as passive as it would be in slumber. Mike moved closer, kneeling down, touching her skin lightly. Though she was already awake, she opened her eyes as if from a deep sleep and smiled that same smile she wore first thing in the morning. Her voice tumbled out softly, \"Hey, what's up?\"");
        calm.add("I have never seen Chester ruffled, and today is no exception. His voice has a husky drawl and every step he takes is in slow motion compared to almost anyone else I know. His idea of hurrying is to bend his head downward a little as he saunters, the pace of his footfalls not changing one iota. That's just the way the man is, born calm, can't change him, wouldn't want to.");
        calm.add("Calm is the forest right after the dawn light has kissed the colours into being. Just being there brings the soul into sweet surrender, at one with nature, vibrant yet relaxed. Every fragrance is fresh, like the page of a new book. Each burst of birdsong is unique, a live chorus to waken the mind, to shake off whatever sleepiness remains. Thoughts and feet wander, lungs fill, time rolls by in its silent and endless way.");
        calm.add("When my hand moves over the canvas it's almost like my mind is directing it without me, odd perhaps, but that's the way it is. My hand moves instinctively to the right spot, building a new picture, often one I have never seen before. In these fantastical worlds I see reflections of my own mind, the way I think, but there is something else there too. I don't know what, perhaps I just imagine it, but when I paint I feel closest to our creator and it gives me a peace and mental calmness I cannot find another way.");


        car.add("The silver gray Mercedes S600 cruised down the freeway, travelling south. Alex was sitting in the front passenger seat with so much soft leather around him that he could barely hear the 389 horsepower, 6-liter engine...At eighty miles per hour the engine was only idling. But Alex could feel the power of the car. One hundred thousand pounds worth of German engineering. One touch from the unsmiling chauffeur and the Mercedes would leap forwards. This was a car that sneered at speed limits.");
        car.add("At the big chicane, the Ferrari, Porsche, and GTR are neck and neck. Eric takes the outside, allowing some room between the three cars.

She had always perceived hospitals as beneficent places of caring and compassion, places to recover and be doted upon by dedicated professionals. And to some extent that had occurred. There were medical staff who never wavered in their genuine concern, who despite a lack of resources never faltered in their humanity. Then there were the disaffected who turned up only to get their pay-check. Today her nurse was a pay-checker. Instead of the dignified bed bath she'd had the day before, only uncovering a small amount of her skin at a time, the harried nurse exposed her entirely. She stared at the ceiling too mortified to speak, not daring to glance at the curtains to check for gaps. When she was re-dressed in a clean gown the nurse pulled back the curtain and announced that her breakfast had arrived, but Rosie had lost her appetite. She just wanted to go home.") ;

        plane.add("The morning sky is mostly cloud, deep steel blue-greys that mirror the hues of the highway. Everything is a muted shade, like a matt photograph in a dimly lit room, everything except the tail lights that flow into the heart of the city. They shine like the first berries on winter holly: unabashedly brilliant, scarlet, hypnotic.");

        rain.add("In late summer the Earth is ready for the rains, for sweet drops to quench the soils. It is then that the pitter patter returns to the woodlands, simple water to bring nature's magic. The pathways strengthen from a dusty brown to deep mahogany, reviving a healthy glow I've longed to see return. Summer foliage has it's time, the green canopy to give shelter when it's needed, yet this is beauty also, the heaven-given promise seasonal changes fulfilled.");
        rain.add("The rain brings a richness to each hue, the browns deepen in a way that soothes my heart, brings a steadiness to my soul. The grass becomes glossy, reflecting the light, a new bright shine to their wands, softly waving in the breeze. This rain brings a freshness, each drop a heaven-given gift for each part of creation. I raise up my hand, tilt my face toward the sky, feeling water and sunshine together. As I do, a song stirs within, one that feels as if it means \"thank you\" and \"love\" all at once. Perhaps this is joy, a happiness that feels pure.");
        rain.add("The rain comes, oblivious to the life it gives. It washes the world, quenching soil and the life whom depend upon it. In either warmth or coldness, sunlight or moonlight, rain comes, humble to its role. In this almost-spring afternoon, it is the percussion to the birdsong and the bringer of brightness to every hue of bark and leaf.");
        rain.add("Rain floats in gentle waves, as if gravity is a soft music from the Earth, a sweet beckoning serenade. Each drop bequeathes itself unto the cooling air - wet lifeboats in a dry sea. Together they paint a new picture around a glowing streetlamp. Light streams into the rich blue, as if seeking the sun, as if it is a song to the moon - and in those sacred drops it blooms into a star like those above. Sarah smiles, because in that moment, the water and the light have become a golden flower, an echo of life bursting into the night.");
        rain.add("I pulled the black hood over my saturated form as I saunter in the soft rain, small pellets of water spitting on my hands as the remainder of the drops quench the scattered puddles decorating the asphalt. Through one of the pools of rainwater, the familiar flash of police sirens are brought to my attention. I manage to lift my head up just a bit.");


        sad.add("Her eyes shifted to the side again and became glazed with a glassy layer of tears. As she blinked, they dripped from her eyelids and slid down her cheeks. She bit her lip tightly in attempt to hide any sound that wanted to escape from her mouth; my heart sank. \n" +
                "Her lower lip quivered as words slowly made their way out of her mouth. \n" +
                "She began, yet what followed was engulfed in the tremors.");
        sad.add("The tears flowed unchecked down her cheeks and dripped from her chin. She was too sad to cry out or wail, she just stood there as still as a statue while the magnitude of her loss swept over her. When asked years later to describe her sadness in the moment she heard of the tragic news of her son's death, her eyes would brim with tears once more, as if all those years had passed in a matter of seconds and she would say nothing. For once again she was lost in the torrid vortex of the moment. It was a moment that carried her forwards until only death could release her from it's clutches. She was forever tormented by a past that could not be undone.");
        sad.add("\"Sad\" sounds so childish, like something flimsy, something one should be able to cast off with a happy reflection or the smile of a friend. But \"sad\" is nothing of the sort. It sits inside like the germ seed of depression, just waiting for the right conditions to grow, to send out roots to choke the hope out of your heart. It is the trough in which we struggle to return to the peak, always afraid that this time the rungs will be too slippery, too far apart or simply not there at all.");
        sad.add("There were days Hayley awoke and her memories weighed heavy. The morning radio came to her through a haze and the smiles of others were no more real than the pixelated icons on her phone. It was temporary of course, but in that permanent way; however high she rose and how long she stayed away this was the base-line she always returned to.");

It can't take no more in, Miss. It can't take no more in. So unless you gonna fix that, unless you gonna care, shut up. Please, for the love of God, shut up. My mom is sick and the rent overdue. My uncle said I'm a looser like me dad. The world is fucked up real bad and the gang got their eyes on me. So like I said, lady up there talking words that bounce off my skull, my mind is already full. So you learn. You learn how to take this shit out. You learn how to take my desire to put your head through that wall and make something calm. You learn how to love your students like a good mother, whatever the hell that is. You learn how to come into my head space, meet me for who I am and not tell me to meet your neat printed government bull crap standards. Because if you don't I'm gonna take a fist full of this anger and pain, this fear that's sat in me since I don't even remember when, and I'm gonna shove it right in your face. Then you'll hate me like all the others. All the others. All of them with their judging eyes from their comfortable lives with those that love them. Why don't you ever learn to see what you are seeing? So, Miss, here is your grade: SEE ME.");

The other kids seem to come alive in art class, amongst the pastels and fine charcoal pencils, but for her the sight of the laboratory was the heaven she craved. Art was amazing, art was beautiful, but not when drawn by her hand. By her hand it was like a three year old with a broken arm was given a crayon and told to have fun. Mr Tobias was beaming at the front of the class, and she fought not to reflect it back, grinning at teachers wasn't cool. But as he announced the new assignment her face fell into a natural look of disbelief, her lips as straight as the pencil on her desk.  Twenty percent of the grade was based on the artwork that went with it. Nine out of ten kids in the class voted to approve the new rubric and Heidi felt like something had just died in her mouth. Twenty percent. She could kiss her A's goodbye.");


        snow.add("Snow rests upon the park bench as if it were a feather cushion, soft and warm. It covers the rich, deep wood in perfect white. The snow is a gift-wrap only spring will open, revealing the engrained beauty that lives safely below, protected these long winter months. As the sun rises each morning, bestowing brilliance, igniting colours to vibrant hues - man dreams below of planting seeds, of the bounty of the gardens to come.");
        snow.add("The park was covered in a thick blanket of white, statutes peeked out under their new white caps, footsteps and paw prints crisscrossed each other around the labyrinth of paths. Aside from the brown of the denuded trees, the only other color was the vivid saffron staining around the base of each lamppost, tree and shrub.");
        snow.add("The street looked like an unfinished painting. So much of the canvas was still perfectly white, as if waiting for the artists hand to return. The morning light struggled through the murky cloud, but even in its weakness it was enough to blind. The air was of course cold, but Maisy hadn't expected the same dampness that comes before rain. Moving from the overbearing heat of the kitchen to the verandah was like sipping on ice-water in the height of summer, until her lips went blue and she scurried back to the roasting winter vegetables and baking apple pie.");
        snow.add("Breath pale against the numbing air, she blinked thoughtfully as the frost patiently kissed her face, captivated by the soft, dusty illusions of light that sat heavy on her eyelashes. She adored the snow, moreso when it was falling.");
        snow.add("The snow hugged the house like a day old baby, new and clingy. It was like the street had been put to bed, hushed under nature's frigid eider-down. How odd it was to look on that view, so familiar and yet so different. There were the same houses with their peaked shingle roofs and the black street-lights that would ordinarily be off already. Whether it was the stoney cloud or the white caps over the sensors, I'm not sure, but they were still sending our their feeble yellow glow.");


        sun.add("I know the sun is a star, I'd just never felt it before. There is such a difference between knowing and feeling. I was in the pine forests, high up the mountainside when the sun was setting. My mind was on getting home; the forests are so enchanting in the light, yet not so much in the blackness. That's when it happened, right after crossing the stream that falls over the rocks, a mini-waterfall I guess. The sun was maybe a third of the way down the pines and dead ahead, shining through the light fog in a way that gave it a myriad of sepia tones. The shafts shone to the right and left from that one focal point that for the most part was hidden. My feet stopped and my eyes opened wider than they had been for the past hours. Like a child, my hands reached up as if they could bathe in the light. The golden beams were radiating all around just like rays from the heavenly bodies we adore after nightfall - yet it was our star, our sun.");
        sun.add("There was nothing I loved more than those hot summer evenings when we would sit on the street and let the sun beat down on our skin. We could feel the tropic, sticky air with each inhalation; the air so thick you could cut through it. I liked the way that, as small gusts of wind blew past me, my skin would softly shiver before returning to its still, warmed state. It made me sleepy, like a silent lullaby of the sun was discreetly blowing my mind out of consciousness. I miss those days together. Those days we spent; just you, me and the sun.");
        sun.add("It is New Year's day. The sun finally shines above the sky after dreadful clouds covering it for weeks. It seems to have had a gorgeous makeover while hiding behind in its private room. The yolk looking sun has turned from yellowish brown to golden. Everyone is coming out and enjoying the warm and beautiful day, feeling the gentle heat. We celebrate the new year and appreciate the sun - giving us this boost of energy to start anew.");
        sun.add("The sun hangs so impossibly in the smoky sky- a perfect circle without strings or supports. Sometimes I imagine it to be a cut-out, that it is in reality a wall of fire behind the heavens. I know it isn't, I paid enough attention in science class to know that it is a fiery sphere, a yellow dwarf star, in the centre of our solar system. But from this grassy hill just outside Telanara City, it looks two dimensional and no further away than the mountains.");
        sun.add("The same sun that sent new green leaves bursting from blackened buds now turns the wands of knee high grasses golden.  These spindles of plants shooting through the sidewalk cracks are enough to tell the children that summer is drawing to a close, waning along with the hours of daylight. This long awaited for vacation, this echo of a bygone era when the young were needed to bring in the harvest, has only days left. Only now there is no more labour in yellow fields, the closest the kids come to it is sitting on the crumbling concrete walls pulling off the swollen seeds.");

        thunder.add("Sydney's cries were lost beneath the thunder that rolled overhead. The sky was so low that even outside on the hills she was claustrophobic. If she didn't find Cindy soon even her scent would be washed away by the oncoming squall. She would be wet, cold and frightened, even the night was encroaching quickly, adding to the gloom. She called out again, shrill but loud, anything to pierce the thick air. She ran on and called again, her words clipped by another oppressive boom. After several long seconds of silence she head a cry, it was a way off that much she could tell and coming from closer to the cliff.");
        thunder.add("The thunder was as good a free trip to the spa. It was a ticket from the slog of the fields to a comfy armchair by the hearth. With every cracking boom his crooked smile became a little wider. By the time he reached the cottage his characteristic grim slash was a boyish smile. After a wash and a change of clothes he stoked the flames and drank in the aroma of his lunch being fixed, guilt free relaxation, dulcet tones from the radio and his dog by his feet. The only thing that could make it better was the drumming of rain on the slate roof, better than a shot of valium but no rival for the amber drink in his hand.");
        thunder.add("The vicar dismounted his horse and looked to the charcoal sky. Then he heard it, like a negative reflection of his own church bells pealing in the distant hills, the thunder rolled across the malevolent sky. The untamed power reverberated and echoed across the green landscape. Without waiting for the coming storm to break he hurried his steed to the stables.");
        thunder.add("The thunder seamed to crack the air, as if the very heavens might split apart. It rolled like the ash could of a volcano, becoming a rolling booming rumble. It declared to all the raw power of nature and gave fair warning of the wrath that was to come.");
        thunder.add("Thunder came like the prelude to a great song, impetuous rumbling permeating the air every bit as much as the sudden rain. At first it was a crack, violent to the ears, but after came a rolling sound that dissipated into the surrounding hills.");


        trainstation.add("The subway station could be a year ago at the dead of night, but perhaps only in a blackout. It's noon and the platform is only occupied by my tatty boots and rucksack. Under the steady beam of my flashlight it's the same old place it ever was. Grey above, grey below and a tunnel of black. The air is just as stale and surprisingly the litter remains, only now it is as stationary as the old train that sits with its doors open. I consider taking a look in there but after a few steps forwards I detect a familiar smell, urine maybe, human definitely. That's not good. I don't play nice with others, not anymore. Without a conscious thought my hand already holds a sharp blade. No-one could tell I'm a girl, not unless they have a light, and most don't. Looking at me from in there they wouldn't even know I'm not a Protector. Then a dark head appears around the corner blinking into the beam, but only two feet from the ground. I almost yell at them to get off their knees, but it's a kid.");
        trainstation.add("The platform at this late hour looks like a murder scene before the crime. There is no-one here but me right now, and since I'm not the killing type I guess that makes me Jane Doe. I stare into the black tunnel, willing those red lights to blink back at me, growing closer, announcing that at least I am on my way. The quiet chills me, nothing good happens in deserted parts of this city. I hold my hand out to feel for the movement of air that comes as the train pushes it along, but there is nothing. Nothing but the dirty grey floor and the worn yellow band under my boots. I shouldn't even be this close to the edge, but it's not like I can get a knock from behind right now. Suddenly adrenaline floods through me and I turn abruptly to stare at the empty platform behind me, paranoia, that's not good either. So I face forwards and diligently study the subway map I already know. I am almost calm when I hear a sneeze.");
        trainstation.add("Ryan slid through the subway throng as efficiently as a deer in a thicket. It was lucky for them he was no pick pocket because he could have easily made more money that way than MI5 paid, and at less personal risk too. His pursuer was now stuck and resorting to standing on tip-toes to see over the heads of the packed-in commuters. Ryan had by now acquired a new hat without its owner noticing and stood on the edge of the platform, sucking in the stale tunnel air to re-oxidize his blood after the hide 'n' run-like-hell game he'd just been playing on the streets of New York. He wasn't supposed to be here of course, the Americans hardly ever gave permission for this kind of operation. The tell-tale displacement of air announced the arrival of the train. Now was the difficult part, to appear to board but actually hide under the lip of the platform until the mobsters had heaved their overly armed bodies either onto the train or away up the stairs.");
        trainstation.add("In the daytime the subway station was a seething mass of humanity. Everyone from every walk of life was shoulder to shoulder, in each other's faces, no personal space, no exceptions. But now at the end of my shift there is space between the people and somehow that makes it all the more awkward. When it's crowded you take in no information about anyone, they are just things in your way. Moving, smelling, awkward, rude things. Now the faces of the city are looking at me. Thinking about me. Judging this girl that normally goes unnoticed in the throng. And I am looking at them, forming opinions, deciding on the safest place to stand, nearer to who, further from who. Then I realize my judgments are based on how well the person dresses and I am ashamed. With a whine and a displacement of air the train arrives and I hurry on. Perched on the hard seat I flick through my phone and look at messages I already read, anything to avoid eye contact.");

        wind.add("I grow strong against this wind; muscles working all the more. It is the freshness over my skin, that which makes a fine flag of my tousled hair. In the trees it is a gusting chorus, a song so confidently sung. There are times I feel it within, that push and swirl, that stirring to show what is solidly there. I'm okay with it; I am. For the calmness of sweet days ahead will be such plain sailing, as easy as summer daydreams.");
        wind.add("I have always loved the wind, for it comes to me so boldly, touches my skin. In coldness it rouses me to wakefulness, an alertness that lets me savour the moments in dryness and rain just the same. In soft breezes it is finer than silk, smoother than water. In the gales it sings through the trees, sending loose leaves on a dancing funfair ride, hypnotic, beautiful. In the summertime wind is cooling, allowing the warmth to gently enter muscle and bone while my skin feels so at ease with the world. Today is almost still and I find myself in joyful anticipation, absorbing the bright colours of the new foliage and buds, taking a moment to watch a dragonfly pass by, its back a brilliant electric blue.");
        wind.add("At dawn the soft susurration of the leaves that been Lila's lullaby through the night became a fierce rustling, loud enough to drown out the chorus of the birds. She sat up and brushed the leaf litter from her tight black curls. In her experience, all thirteen years of it, the wind did not arrive all of a sudden. It should build up gradually and it should weave through the tree trunks a least a little. She licked her finger and held it to the wind, hardly a breeze at all, almost still. Yet above was such a gale that new green leaves were tumbling down, some still attached to their twig. Every fibre of her being commanded her to run, but she was as rooted to the spot as the towering flora about her. The canopy was rapidly disintegrating, the myriad of green hues was now punctuated with shafts of light. The promised wind pushed througj the gaps, pummelling into the soil and whipping the debris into a vortex around her. Lila dived for a tree trunk as the wind escalated to hurricane force.");
        wind.add("The wind was Cynthia's nemesis, but it hadn't always been that way. As a child on the highlands she had built kites with her father and they would fly them on a Sunday after church. Back then a howl to the wind as it gusted around the stone cottage would be as welcome as a greeting from an old friend. She would burst through the timber door with her scarf bound tightly about her neck and just stand there for a moment to feel it's keen cool bite. But times had changed. She wed a fisherman, her childhood sweetheart, and now that howl made her blood run cold. She would clasp her arms about her and pace the floor. When the trees bowed and the birds ceased to fly she knew the sea was a tumult of giant waves, enough to sink a wee painted fishing boat. Sometimes she feared that it's moan had been carried right from the ocean itself, that it was the moan of those men being tossed like inconsequential dolls.");
        wind.add("It was a dark and stormy night and the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies) rattling along the housetops, and fiercely, agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.");
