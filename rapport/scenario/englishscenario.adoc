ReadingMood

This product is designed for readers who want an enhanced experience of reading. ReadingMood is here for them: with olfactive and sound experiences going hand in hand, you will be totally charmed. We offer to combine sound and smell that go along with the theme of your reading. You only need to download the app and are free to buy our connected box, so called Magic Box. In the app you’ll have access to a bookstore full of free books. Once you’ve downloaded a book, it will be added to your personal library and will be accessible at any time and even offline.

You can choose between automatic and manual mode. In manual mode, you will be able to choose your own playlist to personalize your experience. In automatic mode our algorithms will provide you sounds and odors adapted to your reading. 

To make the experience even more intense, the box will contain samples of odors linked with certain vibes to mobilize all your senses. We will use a dozen of smells that will be spread via the sprayers embedded in our Magic Box which is controlled wirelessly from the app. The spray won’t be systematic: only certain themes will have a smell associated to go along with the sounds
