## Project
### Reading Mood
Our project aims to change how people think about reading by making it an experience that mobilizes all your senses. Two ways we will do it, one adding on the other: with headphones you’ll hear sounds that are adapted to your reading wherever you are and when you’re at home our Magic Box will also spray smells that are linked to the vibe of your reading.

This project is  multidisciplinary: designing the Magic Box, automatically determining the ambience of a text, crating the app and integrating everything will require various skills. Everybody in the group has something of interest to them in this project.
